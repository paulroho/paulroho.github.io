Mainly developing for iOS (North American market)

* Enterprise software: younger employees, higher employee turnover
* Trend therefore: consumer-grade UX is the new standard in the enterprise

Why UX:

* Gain **productivity**
* Increase **adoption**
* Decrease user **error**
* Decrease **training** cost

SAP Mobility Design Center:

* Business users tell their needs
* Create prototypes ensure user's delight, technical feasability
* Deliver production ready solution

Showcased different apps

Interesting: different target platforms for different areas in the world:

* App1: iOS, no Android in the US
* App2: even a blackberry app for the canadian market

Example Kiewit (big US construction company):
  
* 200 trucks a day
* before: checkin in central office using backend system  
* many different, often changing users -> no training ->  UX!
* Nice: handwritten like overlays to provide help within the application

Design skillsets get more important
