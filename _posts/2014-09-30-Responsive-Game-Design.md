###Amazon Appstore
* Fire Phone

## Mobile Games
Classical responsive design does not work especially well for games

* Game graphics and UI support multiple resolution
* Game mechanics across multiple types of input
* Publish to multiple platforms with the same codebase
* Saved data is synced across all platforms

###Game Graphics and UI
* Mobile first
* Handling different resolutions -> understand aspect ratios 16:9 and 4:3
* Scale up/down from there

###Input

Virtual Joystick

###Single Code Base
