Classical responsive design does not work especially well for games

* Game graphics and UI support multiple resolution
* Game mechanics across multiple types of input
* Publish to multiple platforms with the same codebase
* Saved data is synced across all platforms

##Game Graphics and UI

* Handling different resolutions -> understand aspect ratios 16:9 and 4:3
* Scale up/down from there

##Input

Virtual Joystick

##Single Code Base
