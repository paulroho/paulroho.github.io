**A Common Misconception:**  
Psychology derives trait from observing behaviour. - **Wrong!**

Psychological research does the opposite:  
*"What is the probability for a behaviour given a trait?"*

**Psychological Effect size**  
Difference/distance between averages

>Why do we think that we are right? -  
Because we want to be right. We're hard wired for that.

**Confirmation Bias**  
Tendency to neglect information that disconfirms our believe: We look for evidence that supports our thinking, we do not look for disconfirm.

Where do I seek for confirm:

* Separating waste helps protect the environment
* Getting enough sleep makes me feel better
* Being too much indoors makes me feel bad
* A loving family helps make children becoming safer adults

You want to look good

Selective perception:

* Selective attention
* Selective interpretation 

Shield us from negative feedback

##Cognition/Metacognition
**Cognition** - information processing  
when we monitor it -> Metacognition - can control cognition
**Metacognition**: how do we think how good we are

People don't see their cognitive inabilities, they **need feedback**

**Metacognitive Training**: align metacognition and cognition

##PIMP 

* **P**erception - *"I did not see you checked in code"*
* **IM**pact - *"That broke the build"*  
  and
* **P**roposal - *"Inform me when you check in code"*
