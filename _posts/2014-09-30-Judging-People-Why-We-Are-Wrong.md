Misconception: Psychology derives trait from observing behaviour. - Wrong!
Psychological research does the opposite: What is the probability for a behaviour given a trait?

Psychological Effect size: difference/distance between averages

Why do we think that we are right? Because we want to be right. We're hard wired for that.

Confirmation Bias: Tendency to neglect information that disconfims our believe: We look for evidence that supports our thinking, we do not look for disconfirm.

Where do I seek for confirm:
* Separating waste helps protect the environment
* Getting enough sleep makes me feel better
* Being too much indoors makes me feel bad
* A loving family helps make children becoming safer adults

You want to look good

Selective perception:

* Selective attention
* Selective interpretation 

Shield us from negative feedback

Cognition - information processing we monitor it -> metacognition - can control cognition
metcognition: how do we think how good we are

People don't see their cognitive inabilities, they ned feedback

Metacognitive Training: align metacognition and cognition

PIMP 
* Perception - I did not see you checked in code
* IMpact - That broke the build
* and
* Proposal - inform me when you checkin code
