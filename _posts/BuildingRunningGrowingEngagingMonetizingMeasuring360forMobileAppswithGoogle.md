Keynote: Building, Running, Growing, Engaging, Monetizing, Measuring – 360° for Mobile Apps with Google
===
by Jens Bussmann (Google)

---
The keynote startet off presenting two images showing the crowd in Rome from the time a pope was to be elected. The first one was taken in 2005. On this picture you could see just a single little feature phone. (Note: At that time, Smartphones as we know them today were not on the market). The second one was taken in 2013. On that picture, there are mobile screens just everywhere.

Then Bussmann stated:

* Not only "Mobile-First", but "Mobile-only". - *Personal side note: For some segments of the market that might even hold true as of today. But especially talking of best-ager consumers, I have the feeling that desktop computers still have a large share in their access to applications.* 
* There are 2.5 Billion mobile users worldwide
* Users do not only use an application, but they are socially connected
* Switching to another application is easy for the user. So keep your users engaged. I have to ensure that users use *my* application.

The first statement from [Google's philosophy](http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/ "Google's philosophy") - "Ten things we know to be true":


> Focus on the user and all else will follow

The Bussmann showed 

# 1. Build Your Game
Google Cloud Platform
Mostly important: helps focus on your user

Snapchat: 3-4 Bill worth, 1.5 employees for backend services

# 2. Grow Your Audience
86% of the times users spend in applications, e.g. not searching the web -> In Web advertising

# 3. Engage Your Players

Diagram Engagement vs. Monetization

Google Analytics

If you have data you have to extract the information that makes a difference.
World cup game Brazil-Germany: rather balanced statistics, but 1:7 in goals.

# 4. Monetize Your Application

1. Sell your application
1bill. active users on Android, 1.5 growth app downloads, 2.4 growth in revenue from Q1/2013-Q1/2014 
2. In App Purchasing AdMob integrating with Goolge Analytics
