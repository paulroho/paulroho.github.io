[Google's philosophy](http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/ "Google's philosophy"):

"1. Focus on the user and all else will follow"

# 1. Build Your Game
Google Cloud Platform
Mostly important: helps focus on your user

Snapchat: 3-4 Bill worth, 1.5 employees for backend services

# 2. Grow Your Audience
86% of the times users spend in applications, e.g. not searching the web -> In Web advertising

# 3. Engage Your Players

Diagram Engagement vs. Monetization

Google Analytics

If you have data you have to extract the information that makes a difference.
World cup game Brazil-Germany: rather balanced statistics, but 1:7 in goals.

# 4. Monetize Your Application

1. Sell your application
1bill. active users on Android, 1.5 growth app downloads, 2.4 growth in revenue from Q1/2013-Q1/2014
