##Thumb size: - Height of buttons, input fields, icons

6 User Interface Differences between Android and iOS apps

## Navigation Bar
* iOS Navigation Bar
	Back button - screen title - text titled control or max 2 icons
* Android App Bar
	Nav icon - screen title (not centered) - action icons - menu icon

* Ad Menu icon:
menu items to the current screen, not for navigation
There is a table for device/orientation, number of icons
max 5 icons: the icons not fitting go to the menu icon 

## Lists
### iOS:
* Chevron
* subtitles go to the right

### Android Lists
* single-line, double-line, three line list
* for more info per item: card
* List items can expand/collapse, not on iOS

## Tabbar
### iOS
* No chevron (UX problem - coming back with material design)
* Always at the button (no interference with hardware controls)
* max 5 buttons, can have "More" button, but consider side bar navigation for more items
* icons, text below
* can slide, can be translucent

### Android:
* Always under the app bar
* max. 6 tabs
* just text, no icons

## Buttons
### iOS
* System buttons, looks just like a link
* Apple itself makes exceptions (e.g. AppStore)
### Android
* Floating action button
* Rectangular Raised button
* Flat button, looks like link -> hint: better not use within screens

## Icons
### iOS AppIcon
* The business card of the application (bad example: associations that go in the web for the new icon for AirBnB)
* Always rounded rectangle (maybe form in it)

### Android AppIcon
* Any outline

#### AppIcon Do's
* Clear silhouette
* clean colors
* platform sepcific

#### AppIcons Don'ts
* text
* mystetrious
* blue
* fotos
* blurry
* small elements

### iOS Icons
Thin (2pt) outline -> inline with text thinness 
### Android Icons

## Navigation
### iOS Navigation
* Tree Structure
* Tabbar
* Deck of cards
* (Dashboard - old fashioned)
* Mixed navigation - combine above
* No Navigation
* Sidebar - not a native element of iOS

### Android Navigation
* Sidebar (native in Android)
* Tabbar
* Stacked cards
