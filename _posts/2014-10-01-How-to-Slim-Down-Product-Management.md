"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."

Things what people say and what they need are different things.

How to include the customer more into your mobile strategy.

No excuses - Mobile is made for customer development

POP - Paper on Phone (clickable prototype)

The non-technical side of customer development - getting into character

Method acting
Impersonating the user (work, life with/like them)
Embodimient: What might I, the user do?

Compared to your user, you know nothiing about your user - Don't ask them if they like your product - "This is so bad, I have no words for it"

#Tools
* Qualitative research with 8-12 users
* Extract what they NEED vs. want
* Care about N00bs - might use a workaround that you could make a feature
* Think beyond the words
* Get out there
* Informal interviews
* Interview in teams
* Don't dominate - try to be weaker than your user, open them up
* OBSERVE as deeply and as long as you can before you go into talking be unobtrusive 
* Open questions - Do not ask "Do you like that feature?"
* Manage silence - encourage people to speak - shut up, give them time to breath, to order their thoughts
* Specific vs. wide-open questions -  Not "What is the best movie?" - instead: "What movie you saw in the last month did you like best?"
* Important: warm-up questions
* Have a script
* Five "whys"
* Don't pitch! - Never pitch, just do not pitch! not: You will have fun, it totally rocks
* Prototype vs. presentation - presentation: description, prototype: early stage
* Provide alternatives - people wouldn't say that something is bad, they would be nice

GET OUT THERE AND GET INTO CHARACTER

Questions:

* How in corporate environments - Stretch the first stage (method acting)
* Quantitative vs. qualitative research - Qualitative research: what will be the next big thing? the next step?, Quantitative research: what did work and what not
Your target group is more heterogeneous than you might think
* What do you think about flat design
* Why do you think why is the user now with mobile apps more in the focus than it was before.
