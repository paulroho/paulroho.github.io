> If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.

* Things what people **say** and what they **need** are **different** things.
* How to include the customer more into your mobile strategy
* No excuses - Mobile is made for customer development
* [POP - Prototyping on Paper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.woomoo.pop&hl=en) (clickable prototype)
* The non-technical side of customer development - getting into character

Method acting

* Impersonating the user (work, life with/like them)
* Embodiment: What might I, the user do?

Compared to your user, **you know nothing about your user**  
*So don't ask them if they like your product*
> "This is so bad, I have no words for it"

##Tools
* **Qualitative research** with 8-12 users
* Extract what they **NEED vs. want**
* **Care about N00bs** - might use a workaround that you could make a feature
* Think **beyond the words**
* **Get out** there
* Informal interviews
* Interview in teams
* **Don't dominate** - try to be weaker than your user, open them up
* **OBSERVE** as deeply and as long as you can **before** you go into **talking**, be unobtrusive 
* **Open questions** - Do not ask "Do you like that feature?"
* Manage **silence** - encourage people to speak - shut up, give them time to breath, to order their thoughts
* Specific vs. wide-open questions -  Not *"What is the best movie?"* - instead: *"What movie you saw in the last month did you like best?"*
* Important: **warm-up** questions
* Have a **script**
* **Five "whys"**
* **Don't pitch!** - Never pitch, just do not pitch!  
 Not: *"You will have fun!"* or *"It totally rocks!"*
* **Prototype vs. presentation**
    * presentation: description
    * prototype: early stage
* Provide **alternatives** - people wouldn't say that something is bad, they would be nice

GET OUT THERE AND GET INTO CHARACTER

##Questions asked while Q&A:

* How in corporate environments - Stretch the first stage (method acting)

* Quantitative vs. qualitative research
    * Qualitative research: what will be the next big thing? the next step?
    * Quantitative research: what did work and what not - Your target group is more heterogeneous than you might think
* What do you think about flat design
* Why do you think why is the user now with mobile apps more in the focus than it was before.
