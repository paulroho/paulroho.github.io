#Challenges
* Usability
* Network
* Tool
* Security
* Release Cycles
* Diversity
* Fragmentation

*How to handle these challenges*

* Risk-based device selection (example: important for a game)
* Emulators & Simulators
* Multi-layer test (example: important for an in-house CRM)

#Risk-based device selection
* Experience
* Statistics
* Boundary Cases
* Exclusions

#Multi-Layer Testing
* Testing pyramid - compared to food pyramid
* Multi-Layer architecture - choose the right layer for each test, not any layer must be skipped, especially not the UI-level, most of the severe bugs appeared on all devices, so can be found by testing on e.g. the service layer

#Emulators and Simulators

WANem - simulate network behavior for mobile testing

##Cons
* Slow
* Not 100% accurate
* No UX
* Hard to install
* System depended
* Update handling

##Pros
* Cheap
* Flexible
* Accurate
* Accessible
* Configurable
