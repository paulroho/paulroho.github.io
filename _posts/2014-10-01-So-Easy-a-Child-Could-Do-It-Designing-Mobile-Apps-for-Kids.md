Consider physical abilities of children of various ages.

Categories in Apple's AppStore:

* 5 & under
* ages 6-8
* ages 9-11

-

* Single hand usage, other hand might rest on the device
* Landscape orientation

##Gestures

###Tap
* Taps and Longtaps should make the same
* Kids appreciate immediate feedback, react on touch rather on lift
* Large hit areas with large gaps inbetween

###Draw
* Might be difficult to stay in touch until the end - support partial completion

###Swipe
* Add an arrow as well

###Drag and Drop
* Leave prematurely dropped item where it was dropped, do not move to the dock

###Not so appropriate
* Double Tap
* Pinch Zoom
* Multi touch
* Shake and Tilt
* Flick and Fling


##Flow of the app
1. Greet the child
2. Give instruction - state objective, how to accomplish the objective - read it (audio might not work well)
3. Timeouts - kid might be distracted, options: give suggestions what to do next, reminder, proceed, shut down
4. Corrections - be nice if kids get an answer wrong, give encouring, incremental feedback ("That was wrong - try again" - "We're looking for the robot" - "It has red eyes" - Let it blink the eyes - move forward - don't block the flow), say it with a smile
5. Rewards - repeat what they done right ("Nice job in drawing the A!"), a sticker screen to collect stickers - kids love it!
6. Feedback - interact with the child (eyes of a character follow movements of gestures or objects
7. End of play - home&replay - show them what to do at the end of the app

##Text and Sound
###Text
* No reading
* Button Icons - use standard buttons metaphors
* Fonts - use the shapes the kids can recognize (different shapes of 'a')
* Highlighting of text (words) in the speed of audio

###Sound
* Background, feedback (right/wrong)
* Make sure not to jump the parents off the cliff
* Concise - "If you want to ... - turn the page" (not the other way around)

##Include Content for Parents
###Register/Login
* Can assume help from grown ups
* Add unique character/image/picture of the child
* Baby Gates - avoid kid coming to purchases, social networks (written instructions, change operation/gestures each time)

###Parent Tips
* Don't expect parents to read
* Be absolutely open what you
* US: CAPA - Children's online privacy protection act

* Sesame Best Practices (2012)
* Design for Kids (Book)
* Apple's Parental Gates Guide
* Moms with Apps (website)
