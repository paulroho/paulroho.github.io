<h1>About<br/>
<small>What I want you to know</small></h1>
<p>{{ site.urlhtml }} is mainly about <em>developing software</em>.</p>
<p>You might find this description somewhat ambiguous. That is intentional.</p>
<p><em>Developing software</em> means two things for me:</p>
<blockquote><span class="text-muted">Developing Software = </span>How to make software</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><span class="text-muted">Developing Software = </span>Software that evolves</blockquote>
<p>On {{ site.urlhtml }} you will find things that cross my mind while working as a software developer. Other topics might come up from time to time.</p>
<p>An emphasis will be on C#, testing and VBA.</p>
<p>{{ site.urlhtml }}  is maintained by <a href="./paul">Paul Rohorzka</a>.</p>
