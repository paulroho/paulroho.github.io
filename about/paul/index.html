<h1>About me<br/>
<small>What I want you to think about me</small></h1>
<p>My name is <a href="/contact">Paul Rohorzka</a>. I live in <a href="http://wien.at/english">Vienna</a>, working as a software developer.</p>

<h3>Past</h3>
<p>My <strong>experience in software development</strong> includes learning and working with Pascal (on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-74">TI-74</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a>, Visual Basic and VBA, C (on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari</a>), C++/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Windows_Library">OWL</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library">MFC</a>, C#/.NET, and all the accompying technologies, tools and languages such as SQL, XML, XSLT to name a few.</p>
<p>I studied (but did not finish) <a href="http://www.nt.tuwien.ac.at/">Telecommunications</a> at the <a href="http://www.tuwien.ac.at/en">Vienna University of Technology</a>. In later stages of my studies I focussed on digital signal processing. While doing project works and while working on my master thesis I was devoloping algorithms for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_56000">Motorola 56k family</a> of digital signal processors, esp. the <a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=DSP56303">Motorola 56303</a>. My master-thesis (a low-delay audio coder) was done as a project for <a href="http://www.akg.com/">AKG Acoustics</a> in Vienna.</p>
<p>For several years I worked as a freelance <strong>technical trainer</strong>, starting with low-level courses for the Microsoft Office family. Soon I started teaching software developers on the Microsoft platform (1200+ hours).</p>
<p>A few years (with varying partners) I tried to build up a software company (<a href="http://www.softconcept.at">softoncept</a>). At softconcept, we were primarly doing projects with Microsoft Access. From that time stems a rather deep know-how regarding VBA development (which I think is better than its reputation). Over the years I could share my knowledge by presenting at the <a href="http://donkarl.com?aek">Access Entwickler Konferenz</a> (Access Developer's Conference) in Germany.</p>

<h3>Present</h3>
<p>The main focus of my work is backend development with C# since the early versions of the .NET platform. I have a strong interest in producing <strong>software that people love to use</strong> and that is <strong>easy to maintain</strong>. Therefore I am promoting the mindsets of <strong>clean code</strong> and <strong>automatic software testing</strong>, utilizing practices such as TDD, BDD/ATDD.</p>
<p>Currently I try to <strong>broaden my knowledge</strong> to technologies beside the Microsoft stack, namely <strong>web development</strong> (HTML5, CSS3, <a href="http://angularjs.org">angularjs</a>) and development for <strong>mobile devices</strong>. Also, I try to familiarize myself with Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Maintaining {{ site.urlhtml }} should help me on that way.</p>
<p>Since 2006 I am happy to work at <a href="http://www.techtalk.at">TechTalk</a>, a Vienna based consultancy (originator of <a href="http://specflow.org">SpecFlow</a>).</p>

<h3>Private</h3>
<p>Beyond my professional life I am deeply grateful to be part a wonderful familiy. I love reading books (fiction and technical), and spending time with friends playing music or hiking the Austrian mountains (much too rarely, I confess).</p>
