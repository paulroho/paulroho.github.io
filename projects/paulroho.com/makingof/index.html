<h1>The Making of {{ site.urlhtml }}</h1>

<p>{{ site.urlhtml }} is currently a work in progress. Since I like the idea of make projects openly, I use this page as a kind of todo-list or backlog.</p>

<h2>Backlog</h2>
<p>The following lists things I need or want to have on {{ site.urlhtml }}. Along with each item it shows the status of it's implementation.</p>
